SOLIDIFICATION TEMPERATURES FOR Cu-40Ni ALLOY
================================================

Based on the equilibrium phase fraction simulation results:

SOLIDIFICATION BEGINS (Liquidus Temperature):
- Temperature: 1526.8°C (1799.8 K)
- At this temperature, the first solid phase (FCC-A1) begins to form
- The alloy is 99% liquid and 1% solid at this point
- This represents the upper boundary of the two-phase region

SOLIDIFICATION ENDS (Solidus Temperature):
- Temperature: 1231.9°C (1504.9 K)
- At this temperature, the last liquid phase disappears
- The alloy is 99% solid and 1% liquid at this point
- This represents the lower boundary of the two-phase region

MELTING RANGE:
- Total melting range: 295.0°C
- This is the temperature range over which both liquid and solid phases coexist
- The alloy undergoes gradual solidification over this temperature range

PHASE FRACTION BEHAVIOR:
- Below 1231.9°C: 100% FCC-A1 solid solution
- 1231.9°C to 1526.8°C: Two-phase region (Liquid + FCC-A1)
- Above 1526.8°C: 100% Liquid phase

IMPORTANCE FOR PROCESSING:
- The wide melting range (295°C) makes this alloy suitable for:
  * Casting processes (good fluidity over wide temperature range)
  * Welding (gradual solidification reduces cracking)
  * Heat treatment (controlled cooling through two-phase region)
  * Powder metallurgy (sintering in two-phase region)

TECHNICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
- These temperatures are critical for:
  * Setting furnace temperatures for heat treatment
  * Determining cooling rates for desired microstructures
  * Avoiding hot cracking during welding
  * Optimizing casting parameters
