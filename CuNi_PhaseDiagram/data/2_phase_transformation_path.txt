PHASE TRANSFORMATION PATH DURING COOLING
========================================

COOLING SEQUENCE FOR Cu-40Ni ALLOY (X(Ni) = 0.40):

1. INITIAL STATE (T > 1526.8°C):
   - Single-phase liquid (L)
   - Complete atomic mixing of Cu and Ni
   - Random atomic arrangement
   - High atomic mobility

2. NUCLEATION PHASE (T ≈ 1526.8°C):
   - First solid nuclei appear
   - FCC-A1 solid solution begins to form
   - Nucleation occurs at grain boundaries or impurities
   - Critical undercooling required for nucleation

3. TWO-PHASE REGION (1526.8°C > T > 1231.9°C):
   - Coexistence of liquid and solid phases
   - Gradual transformation from liquid to solid
   - Phase composition changes with temperature:
     * Liquid becomes richer in Cu (lower melting point)
     * Solid becomes richer in Ni (higher melting point)
   - Lever rule applies for phase fractions

4. SOLIDIFICATION MECHANISM:
   - Dendritic growth pattern
   - Solid grows into liquid
   - Composition gradients develop
   - Diffusion controls transformation rate

5. FINAL SOLIDIFICATION (T ≈ 1231.9°C):
   - Last liquid disappears
   - Single-phase FCC-A1 solid solution
   - Complete atomic mixing in solid state
   - Random substitutional solid solution

6. COOLING BELOW SOLIDUS (T < 1231.9°C):
   - Single-phase solid solution maintained
   - No further phase transformations
   - Possible precipitation of secondary phases at very low temperatures
   - Microstructural changes due to grain growth

KINETIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- Cooling rate affects:
  * Dendrite arm spacing
  * Composition homogeneity
  * Grain size
  * Residual stresses

- Slow cooling (equilibrium):
  * Complete diffusion
  * Homogeneous composition
  * Large grains

- Fast cooling (non-equilibrium):
  * Composition gradients (coring)
  * Fine grains
  * Higher strength

MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION:
1. Liquid → Nucleation → Dendritic growth
2. Primary dendrites form first
3. Secondary and tertiary arms develop
4. Interdendritic regions solidify last
5. Final solidification of eutectic regions (if any)

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
- Controlled cooling rates prevent:
  * Hot cracking
  * Composition segregation
  * Residual stresses
- Heat treatment can homogenize composition
- Annealing relieves internal stresses
