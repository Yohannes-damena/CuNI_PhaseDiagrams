Al–30Lu (approximated via Al–Y proxy) – Analysis and Interpretation

Scope and caveat
- This report uses an Al–Y rare-earth proxy and a schematic approximation because an assessed Al–Lu binary TDB was not available in a directly parsable format. The topology (presence of eutectic/peritectic and intermetallic formation) is representative of Al–rare-earth systems, but specific temperatures and phase identities should be treated as illustrative rather than definitive for Al–Lu.

1) Solidification path of Al-30Lu (X(Lu)=0.30, proxy Al–Y)
- Primary solidification: On cooling from the liquid, a primary rare-earth–rich solid phase (typically an ordered intermetallic in Al–RE systems) nucleates first. In the schematic, liquid fraction decreases steadily from a high-temperature liquidus to a pseudo-solidus as solid fraction increases.
- Invariant reaction: The composition lies closer to the peritectic (P) region than the eutectic (E). The path intersects a peritectic-like transformation near ~1350 K (schematic), where liquid + primary solid → secondary solid (a different intermetallic or matrix phase). This shows up as a change in phase evolution along cooling.
- Eutectic: The eutectic region is placed around X(RE)≈0.15, ~1100 K in the schematic. Al-30Lu (proxy 30Y) does not pass exactly through the eutectic point; therefore, the dominant invariant along its path is peritectic rather than eutectic in this approximation.
- Phases appearing/disappearing during cooling: Liquid appears first at high temperature and vanishes at/just below the invariant temperature range; primary solid appears first, then is partially consumed during the peritectic to form a secondary solid. At lower temperatures, only solids remain (no liquid). Specific identities (e.g., AL2RE, AL3RE, FCC_A1, HCP_A3) depend on the assessed Al–Lu database; here they are represented generically as “primary solid” and “secondary solid.”

2) Comparison to a simpler isomorphous system (e.g., Cu–Ni)
- Cu–Ni: Single FCC phase field from liquidus to solidus (complete solid solubility), no eutectic/peritectic, smooth liquidus/solidus curves, and continuous solid-solution strengthening. Solidification path is: Liquid → FCC, with no invariant reactions.
- Al–rare-earth (proxy for Al–Lu): Multiple ordered intermetallics and narrow homogeneity ranges; invariant reactions (eutectic and peritectic) partition the diagram; solidification often occurs by primary intermetallic formation followed by invariant reactions. This produces multiphase microstructures at cast state and non-monotonic phase-fraction evolution vs temperature.

3) Role of rare-earth elements in phase stability and transformation kinetics
- Phase stability: Rare-earth additions strongly stabilize ordered intermetallic compounds with large negative formation enthalpies and high melting points. These phases frequently have narrow composition ranges and can dominate the phase diagram topology (numerous intermetallic fields, eutectics/peritectics).
- Kinetics: RE atoms are large and diffuse relatively slowly in Al; peritectic transformations (L + primary → secondary) may be diffusion-limited, leading to incomplete peritectic conversion or layered microstructures. Eutectic reactions can generate fine-scale lamellae/colonies, refining microstructure.
- Thermophysical effects: Increased liquidus temperatures on RE-rich sides, wider solidification intervals, and stronger segregation tendencies; intermetallics can act as potent strengtheners but may introduce brittleness if coarse or continuous.

4) Implications for alloy design and processing
- Composition targeting:
  - Near-eutectic compositions are attractive for castability (low freezing range, fine eutectic microstructures) but need control over intermetallic morphology to avoid brittleness.
  - Avoid exact peritectic compositions in processes sensitive to peritectic cracking or where diffusion-limited transformations are problematic; if unavoidable, tailor cooling rates/hold times to facilitate transformation completion.
- Processing windows:
  - Casting: Expect partitioning and segregation of RE to intermetallics; control solidification rate and feed path to mitigate hot tearing and macrosegregation.
  - Thermomechanical processing: High-temperature phase fields and intermetallic stability constrain forging/rolling windows; select temperatures that keep deleterious phases minimal while maintaining workability.
  - Heat treatments: Use solution plus aging to disperse fine intermetallic precipitates for strengthening; avoid over-aging that coarsens brittle particles. RE intermetallics can provide stable dispersoids for creep and oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures.
- Applications:
  - Structural components requiring high-temperature strength and creep resistance can benefit from controlled RE intermetallic dispersion.
  - Casting-intensive components may leverage near-eutectic designs for fluidity and microstructure refinement, with post-cast heat treatments to optimize toughness.

5) Summary (approximation-based)
- For Al-30Lu (approximated via Al–Y), the solidification path predominantly intersects a peritectic-type reaction; eutectic behavior is more relevant at lower RE contents (~0.15 in the schematic).
- Primary RE-rich solids appear first; during peritectic cooling, liquid and primary solid transform into a secondary solid. Liquid disappears below the invariant range; only solids remain thereafter.
- Compared to Cu–Ni, Al–RE systems are topologically complex due to multiple intermetallics and invariant reactions, leading to richer (and more processing-sensitive) solidification pathways.
- Rare-earth elements stabilize ordered intermetallics and can slow diffusion, impacting both microstructure scale and transformation completion. These features can be harnessed for high-temperature performance but require careful alloy/process design to avoid brittleness and processing defects.
